# python-boiler
# Collection of boiler code in Python to get scripting projects started faster:

1- "design-pytherns": Behind the lame play of words are applied design patterns in python. Not very sophisticated code but an attempt at putting the design pattern theory into practice.  <br />
2- Python one liners. Because they are people spending weeks trying to reduce a function from 200 to 100 characters. And that simplicity at the same time is considered pythonic... and needs explanation. Or? <br />
3- "tkinter-select-file-box": Tkinter starter code for launching a python script. Executable that request the user to select a input file on windows. Outputs a log. Coupled with a Pyinstaller script to transform a python script in an executable on Windows. <br />
