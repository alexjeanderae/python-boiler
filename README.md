# python-boiler

My go-to  collection of Python boilerplate, concept recaps as well as cheat sheets. I regularly use these across both professional and personal projects. This repository gathers practical snippets, patterns, and techniques from a range of sources, including insightful YouTubers like Arjan Codes, resources like Refactoring.Guru, foundational books like *Head First Design Patterns*, and invaluable community insights from Stack Overflow. It’s an amalgamation of what I’ve encountered and put into practice over time. I try to give credit when I use a source.

## Contents

1. **Design Pytherns**  
   A playful word twist on “design patterns” and Python. This directory covers essential design patterns such as Strategy, Singleton, and Object Pool—applied to real-world examples. Each snippet showcases how patterns can streamline Python code and enhance readability. Beyond design patterns, you’ll also find programming techniques like memoization and fundamental concepts like `self` and `super` in Python, making this directory a useful toolkit for writing structured and effective code.

2. **Python One-Liners**  
   A collection of Python one-liners that cut down complex code to a single, readable line. I don't use them much but I find them facinating and like to be able to go back to them quickly.

3. **Tkinter File Selector**  
   A Tkinter-based script that prompts users to select an input file on Windows, with logging capabilities. This directory includes PyInstaller configuration files to compile the script into a standalone executable, ideal for distribution to non-Python users (ie technical people that gravitate around me but cannot run a py file).

4. **OpenAI API Cheat Sheet**  
   Handy code snippets for setting up and working with the OpenAI API. This section contains commonly used functions and tips, helping you integrate OpenAI's tools quickly and efficiently without diving into lengthy documentation each time. Not sure it is up to date, I'd like to add some more in there about chunking, embeddings as well as using vector database.

5. **Azure Patterns and Quick Links**  
   A set of Azure-specific patterns and quick reference links to essential Azure documentation. These links save time navigating the vast Azure and Microsoft Learn sites, providing a direct path to key resources for common integrations and configurations in Python.
