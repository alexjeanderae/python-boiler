# Object Pool Pattern


# Hereâ€™s an example of the **Object Pool Pattern** adapted for a **robotics simulation** where reusable objects represent **Robot instances**. In robotics, instantiating a robot or preparing a robot for a task can be resource-intensive, especially if each robot needs specific initial configurations. An **Object Pool** can help manage these robot instances, offering them to clients as needed and returning them when the task completes.



# ### Robotics Example with Object Pool Pattern

# In this example:
# - **RobotPool** manages a fixed pool of `Robot` instances.
# - **Robot instances** are acquired for tasks, used temporarily, and then returned to the pool, making them available for other tasks.
# - This setup improves efficiency by avoiding repeated instantiation and configuration of `Robot` objects.

    for task in tasks:
        robot = robot_pool.acquire_robot()
        if robot:
            robot.perform_task(task)
            robot_pool.release_robot(robot)

### Explanation

# 1. **Robot Class**:
#    - Represents an individual robot that performs a task. Each robot has a unique `robot_id` and a method `perform_task` to simulate performing a specific task.

# 2. **RobotPool Class**:
#    - Manages the pool of robots, keeping track of available robots in `_available_robots`.
#    - **acquire_robot**: Returns a robot from the pool if available; otherwise, it prints a message indicating no robots are free.
#    - **release_robot**: Returns a robot back to the pool, making it available for the next task.

# 3. **Usage in Main**:
#    - Creates a `RobotPool` with 3 robots.
#    - Simulates tasks by acquiring a robot from the pool, performing the task, and releasing the robot back to the pool.

# ### Key Benefits
# - **Efficiency**: By reusing robots rather than instantiating new ones for each task, the pool improves resource management.
# - **Performance**: This pattern is beneficial in scenarios where the setup or initialization of robots is costly and the pool size can satisfy concurrent needs without creating excessive instances.

# This approach makes the robotics system scalable while avoiding the high costs associated with frequent instantiation. The **Object Pool Pattern** is particularly useful when managing finite, expensive-to-create resources in a controlled way.
