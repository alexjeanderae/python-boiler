# Using the **Singleton Pattern** in Python ensures that only **one instance** of a given class is created, even if that class is instantiated multiple times. This is particularly useful for shared resources, like a daily password hash generator. Here’s an improved version with explanations, adding structure and comments to make it clearer.

###  Singleton Implementation

# 1. **Singleton Metaclass**: The `Singleton` metaclass manages instances by overriding the `__call__` method.
# 2. **Usage in a Singleton Class**: We’ll define `HashGenerator` (a class that uses this metaclass) to simulate generating a password hash once per day.
# 3. **Clarification of Metaclass**: Python classes are objects, and a metaclass (like `Singleton`) defines the rules for creating these objects.

### Code

import hashlib
import datetime

# Singleton metaclass to ensure one instance per class
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        # Check if an instance already exists
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            # Create a new instance if none exists
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        # Return the existing instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

# Example Singleton class for daily password hash generation
class HashGenerator(metaclass=Singleton):
    def __init__(self):
        self._last_generated = None
        self._hash_value = None

    def generate_daily_hash(self, password: str):
        # Only generate a new hash if it hasn't been generated today
        today = datetime.date.today()
        if self._last_generated != today:
            # Generate hash and store it with today's date
            self._hash_value = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()
            self._last_generated = today
            print("Generated new hash.")
        else:
            print("Using cached hash from today.")
        return self._hash_value

# Usage
hash_gen1 = HashGenerator()
print(hash_gen1.generate_daily_hash("my_secret_password"))  # Generates a new hash

# Subsequent calls on the same day use the cached hash
hash_gen2 = HashGenerator()
print(hash_gen2.generate_daily_hash("my_secret_password"))  # Uses cached hash

### Notes:
# - **Singleton Behavior**: Both `hash_gen1` and `hash_gen2` refer to the same instance, demonstrating the Singleton Pattern.
# - **Single Daily Execution**: If `generate_daily_hash` is called multiple times in one day, it will reuse the hash generated in the first call.
# - **Metaclasses in Python**: Metaclasses define how classes are created, allowing custom behavior (like singleton instantiation) that operates at the class level rather than instance level.
